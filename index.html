        <h1>Hi, I'm Sevde Salkƒ±m!üë©‚Äçüíª</h1>
        <p>
          I am a student at Karab√ºk University and a software developer with one
          year of experience in front-end development. <br /><br />
          My career path in front-end development has been shaped by my passion
          for web technologies and user experience design. My experience in this
          field allows me to consistently enhance my abilities in creating
          user-friendly, impressive, and accessible websites using modern web
          technologies. I effectively utilize fundamental technologies such as
          HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to bring web projects to life.<br /><br />
          As a student at Karab√ºk University, I am committed to continually
          updating and improving my skills while focusing on sustainable design
          principles, performance, and user experience in the field of web
          development.<br /><br />
          In the future, I aspire to continue learning and gaining more
          experience in web development. My passion for creating creative and
          innovative solutions to enhance users' experiences in the digital
          world drives me forward.
